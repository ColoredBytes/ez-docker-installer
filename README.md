## :x: Problem

I use docker for a lot of my Homelab and currently run it on Rocky Linux. Which works great BTW! The issue I had was that Dockers install script located [Here](https://get.docker.com/) currently does not have support for RHEL-like systesms minus [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/) and [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/) for s390x architecture.

## :heavy_check_mark: Solution

So I made this to make it easier on myself and perhaps others so we don't need to manually install all the time. 

## :gear: Instructions

- **Clone Repo.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColoredBytes/ez-docker-installer.git
```
- **Run the script.**
 
 ```bash
./ez-docker-installer/install.sh
```

## :memo: Notes
> [!NOTE]
> - You still need to add other users if you want them to run docker commands that can be done with.
>    - `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`<br>
> - This script installs the CE Edition of both not Business. That needs to be upgraded manually.
